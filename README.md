## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was my fisrt project as a frontend beginner. I learned how to do some responsive design with media queries.
I also learned how to organize a project and estimate time to develop each part it.
It was very interesting but I've spent an incredibly time on it, I hope I will be faster and more confident with the next challenge.

### Continued development

Hardest part for me was organizing the CCS. Especially managing to have the same marging between elements with Flexbox.
I really want to improve my skills using Flexbox fluently. I've lost too much time on it. There are some behaviors I still can't understand now.
I'm sure the way I did it is not the best so if you have any advises feel free to suggest me alternative ideas.
I'm pressed to start a new challenge and becoming more confortable with that tool.
